# Influenza-virus-Excel-Tableau
# Objective
This project is analyzing past influenza mortality rates across the 50 states to gauge where to 
send additional medical personnel for the upcoming influenza season. To know how much 
medical staff to send to each state, we need to look at the population of vulnerable people within 
each state and the number of influenza deaths across each state.
# Data Source: 
The data source collected was from an external source from the US Census 
Bureau. The data is considered trustworthy because it was collected by the United 
States Federal Government.
